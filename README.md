# Electronic-Sales

### Getting Started
This is a dashboard that shows the sales of electronics around the states in Nigeria and also the profit generated across the different channels.

### Prerequisites
We made sure the data for our DAX was available. This was made available by SULPHIL TECH HUB

We used PowerBi for the exploration and for creating new columns to acheive our results as displayed on the dashboard.

### Usage
Navigate your way around to get the information needed from the dashboard.
